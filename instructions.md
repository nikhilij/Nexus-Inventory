Good — I'll make this explicit and prescriptive so you and your team can choose a clear path. I’ll cover the two main architecture choices (monolith-in-Next.js vs separate Node backend), the tradeoffs, exactly which server-side components you should build, where to put business logic, recommended technologies and libraries (including Node + MongoDB specifics), data-model guidance, API contracts, background workers, deployment/scale notes, and a practical checklist + next actions. At the end I’ll show small concrete examples (Mongoose schema + Next.js route handler) you can copy.

What I’ve done: laid out clear, actionable architecture options and a recommended path for starting the project.
What’s next: pick one of the two recommended approaches (I recommend a monolithic Next.js-first approach for an MVP), and I can scaffold the repository structure, example schemas, auth setup, and a few API routes and pages.

High-level decision: two valid approaches
1. Monolithic Next.js (recommended for MVP / faster iteration)
   - Single Next.js app (App Router + Server Components) contains UI, server routes, and direct DB access.
   - Server-side code (data access, business rules) lives in server components or route handlers and calls MongoDB (via Mongoose or Prisma).
   - Background workers (BullMQ/Redis) run in separate processes (container or server) for async tasks.
   - Pros: faster iteration, simpler dev UX, single repo for front/back, easier to use Next.js Server Components to fetch server data directly.
   - Cons: can get large if you keep adding responsibilities; harder to scale independent services.

2. Separate backend (Node.js microservice(s) + Next.js frontend)
   - Next.js is purely frontend (client + server components for presentation only) and talks to a dedicated Node.js API (Express/Nest/Fastify) that owns business logic and DB.
   - Good if you expect heavy scale, many integrations, different release cycles between UI and APIs, or lots of background processing/AI inference.
   - Pros: clear separation, easier to scale backend independently, better for complex business logic and long-running jobs.
   - Cons: more infra complexity initially, slower iteration.

Recommended start: Monolithic Next.js + MongoDB (MVP -> split later)
- Why: You get full advantage of Next.js Server Components and route handlers to keep server-side logic colocated, iterate quickly, and ship features faster. As needs grow, extract heavy services (AI inference, billing, search, ETL) into microservices.

Stack recommendations (monolith-first)
- Next.js (App Router, Server Components) — v13+ (App Router)
- TypeScript everywhere
- MongoDB (Atlas) — use Mongoose (mature) or Prisma (supports MongoDB but has limitations)
- Auth: NextAuth.js + MongoDB adapter or Clerk if you want a hosted auth
- Background jobs: BullMQ + Redis (hosted Redis Cloud)
- API style: Next.js route handlers (app/api/*/route.ts) for server-only endpoints (webhooks, file-signing, AI calls)
- Caching & state: React Server Components + TanStack Query on client for mutations/optimistic updates
- UI: Tailwind + Radix/shadcn UI components
- Logging/Monitoring: Sentry, structured logs, and metrics (Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog)
- Deploy: Vercel for Next.js UI + serverless, use a small container (ECS/Fargate, DigitalOcean) for the Redis/Bull worker and heavier backend jobs. MongoDB Atlas for DB.

Why Mongoose vs Prisma for MongoDB
- Mongoose
  - Pros: mature, most community packages support it, flexible schema definitions, middleware/hooks, transactions support with replica sets.
  - Cons: slightly more boilerplate vs Prisma type-safety.
- Prisma (Mongo)
  - Pros: TypeScript-first, strong DX, single ORM if you later switch to SQL.
  - Cons: Mongo support is improving but still has limitations (less mature than Prisma with Postgres). Evaluate feature parity for your use cases.

Server components and server-side responsibilities — clear division
- Server Components (React Server Components in app/*)
  - Use them for pages that fetch data and render on the server (dashboards, product catalogs, inventory snapshots, read-heavy pages).
  - They can directly import server-only libs (Mongoose/Prisma clients) and render HTML fast without client JS.
  - Examples: app/dashboard/page.tsx, app/inventory/[warehouse]/page.tsx, app/products/page.tsx

- Client Components ("use client")
  - Use for interactive UI elements, forms, drag/drop, heavy client-side state, and where you need hooks (React Query, local UI state).
  - Examples: product edit modal, barcode scanner client, reorder modal.

- Route Handlers (app/api/*/route.ts)
  - Use for API actions, webhooks, file upload presigned URL creation, AI proxy calls that must keep API keys secure.
  - Use them for synchronous and short-running mutations from the client.
  - Examples: app/api/products/route.ts, app/api/stock-movement/route.ts, app/api/webhook/supplier/route.ts

- Background Workers (outside Next.js or as separate process)
  - Heavy/async tasks (reorder automation, reports, large AI model inference, file processing) should be queued and processed by BullMQ workers.
  - Workers should be separate Node processes (Docker container) and connect to Redis + MongoDB.

Detailed list of server-side components to build (what, where, responsibilities)
For each component I label: Location (Server Component page / route handler / worker / DB-only), Purpose, Notes.

1) Auth & Session
- Location: NextAuth.js server routes, middleware (app/middleware.ts)
- Purpose: Sign-in, SSO, session cookies, role injection, RBAC checks.
- Notes: Protect both UI routes (middleware) and API routes (server auth checks). Keep admin-only endpoints server-side enforced.

2) Company & Onboarding
- Location: Server components + route handlers
- Purpose: Create company, default settings, billing metadata, invite users.
- Notes: Multi-tenant pattern — isolate data by companyId on every write/read.

3) User Management & RBAC
- Location: Route handlers for CRUD, server components for UI pages
- Purpose: Roles (Admin, Manager, Operator), permissions matrix.
- Notes: Always validate role on server operations.

4) Product CRUD & Catalog
- Location: Server components (listing pages) + route handlers (create/update/delete)
- Purpose: SKU, barcode, variants, minStock, supplier links, attributes.
- Notes: Use server components to render product listing server-side; use client components for in-table editing and forms.

5) Warehouse & Location Management
- Location: Server components + route handlers
- Purpose: Multi-warehouse support, zones, capacities, location metadata.

6) InventoryItem & Stock (core)
- Location: Server components for inventory view, route handlers for mutations, DB-level transactions for stock adjustments.
- Purpose: Track quantity per warehouse, batch, lot, expiry.
- Notes: Implement strong integrity on writes: use optimistic concurrency or transactions on the DB (MongoDB transactions require replica set/Atlas).

7) Stock Movement / Transactions
- Location: Route handlers and background worker for complex moves
- Purpose: Record inbound/outbound/transfer, keep audit records, revert on failure.
- Notes: Each stock change MUST create an immutable StockMovement record. Use transactions for paired updates (decrement source + create movement + increment dest).

8) Purchase Orders & Receipts
- Location: Server components + route handlers + worker for supplier sync
- Purpose: Create PO, update status, receive items, match invoices.
- Notes: PO lifecycle enforced on server business logic.

9) Sales Orders & Fulfillment
- Location: Route handlers + server components
- Purpose: Reservation of stock, picking/packing flows, shipping integration.
- Notes: Implement reservation semantics to avoid overselling.

10) Suppliers & Integrations
- Location: Route handlers + webhooks
- Purpose: Supplier catalog, supplier portals, EDI/webhook endpoints.

11) Auditing & Logs
- Location: DB (immutable collection), route handlers for querying
- Purpose: Every change recorded (who, when, delta), searchable audit log for compliance.
- Notes: Avoid mutable logs; write separate collection AuditLog.

12) Search & Filtering Layer
- Location: Separate search service or MongoDB Atlas Search + route handler proxy
- Purpose: Fast search across SKUs, names, attributes.
- Notes: For scale, use ES or Algolia; for simpler cases, MongoDB Atlas Search is fine.

13) AI Integration Endpoints
- Location: Server-only route handlers + separate microservice for heavy inference
- Purpose: Demand forecasting, anomaly detection, image classification, NLU queries.
- Notes: Route handlers should queue heavy AI tasks to workers and return job IDs, not run long inference synchronously.

14) Files & Media (images, invoices)
- Location: Route handlers to create presigned S3 URLs; client uploads directly to S3
- Purpose: Avoid passing large binary through Next.js server
- Notes: Keep signed upload short-lived and validate content type on server.

15) Webhooks (eCommerce/3rd-party)
- Location: Route handlers (app/api/webhooks/*/route.ts)
- Purpose: Accept notifications from Shopify/Amazon/ERP; ack & queue processing.
- Notes: Validate signatures, idempotency key handling.

16) Notifications & Alerts
- Location: Worker for email/SMS push, server route to create alerts
- Purpose: Low-stock notifications, PO updates, shipment updates.
- Notes: Use 3rd-party (SendGrid, Twilio). Queue notifications.

17) Background Jobs / Workers
- Location: Separate Node worker process (Docker container)
- Purpose: Reorder automation, scheduled analytics, long AI tasks
- Notes: Use BullMQ with Redis; workers subscribe to queues and process reliably.

18) Exports & Reports
- Location: Worker for heavy reports (CSV, Excel), route handler to generate light reports
- Purpose: Periodic/export reports, compliance reporting.

Data modeling guidance for MongoDB (collections)
- companies
- users
- products
- inventoryItems (or stockLevels)
- warehouses
- stockMovements

Example Mongoose schemas (concrete)
```ts
// Product model (Mongoose)
import { Schema, model, Document } from "mongoose";

interface IProduct extends Document {
  name: string;
  sku: string;
  barcode?: string;
  description?: string;
  category?: string;
  variants?: Record<string, any>[];
  supplierIds: string[];
  minStock: number;
  companyId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

const ProductSchema = new Schema<IProduct>({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  sku: { type: String, required: true, index: true },
  barcode: { type: String },
  description: String,
  category: String,
  variants: { type: Array, default: [] },
  supplierIds: { type: [String], default: [] },
  minStock: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  companyId: { type: String, required: true, index: true },
}, { timestamps: true });

export default model<IProduct>("Product", ProductSchema);
```

```ts
// InventoryItem model (Mongoose)
import { Schema, model, Document } from "mongoose";

interface IInventoryItem extends Document {
  productId: string;
  warehouseId: string;
  quantity: number;
  batch?: string;
  expiryDate?: Date;
  companyId: string;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

const InventoryItemSchema = new Schema<IInventoryItem>({
  productId: { type: String, required: true, index: true },
  warehouseId: { type: String, required: true, index: true },
  quantity: { type: Number, required: true, default: 0 },
  batch: String,
  expiryDate: Date,
  companyId: { type: String, required: true, index: true },
}, { timestamps: { createdAt: true, updatedAt: 'lastUpdated' }});

export default model<IInventoryItem>("InventoryItem", InventoryItemSchema);
```

Example Next.js route handler (server-side)
```ts
// app/api/products/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import Product from "@/lib/models/Product";
import connect from "@/lib/mongo";

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  await connect();
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const q = url.searchParams.get("q") || "";
  const companyId = url.searchParams.get("companyId");
  const filter: any = { companyId };
  if (q) filter.$text = { $search: q };
  const products = await Product.find(filter).limit(100).lean();
  return NextResponse.json(products);
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  await connect();
  const body = await request.json();
  // validate body + auth
  const created = await Product.create(body);
  return NextResponse.json(created, { status: 201 });
}
```

Important integrity points (how to write server-side logic)
- Always include companyId on reads/writes for multi-tenancy.
- Use DB transactions for any multi-document atomic changes (MongoDB transactions require replica set / Atlas).
- Never trust client-provided totals: Recompute critical values server-side.
- All permission checks must be enforced on the server (not only UI).

API design suggestions (REST endpoints)
- GET /api/products?companyId=...&q=...
- POST /api/products
- GET /api/products/:id
- PATCH /api/products/:id
- POST /api/stock-movement (body: fromWarehouse, toWarehouse, productId, qty, reason) — creates StockMovement + updates InventoryItem(s) inside transaction
- GET /api/inventory?warehouseId=&productId=
- POST /api/purchase-orders
- POST /api/webhook/shopify

When to split into separate backend services
- High concurrency (lots of requests that cause DB contention)
- Heavy AI inference that needs GPUs or long runtimes
- Different teams owning API vs UI
- Need different scaling characteristics (UI on CDN, API on dedicated fleet)

Deployment and infra notes
- Next.js on Vercel (good for server components + edge functions). But be careful:
  - Vercel serverless functions are ephemeral and not ideal for long-running jobs or workers.
  - Use managed MongoDB Atlas for DB.
  - Host BullMQ workers in a container (ECS/Fargate, DigitalOcean App, Heroku Worker, etc.).
  - Use Redis Cloud or managed Redis.
- If you must run everything in one cluster, consider running Next.js on a container host (AWS ECS/GKE) to host both app + worker in separate tasks.

Security & compliance (essentials)
- Store secrets in environment manager (Vercel secret envs, AWS Parameter Store).
- Use httpOnly secure cookies for sessions.
- Apply rate limits and signature verification for webhooks.
- Use data retention and delete API for GDPR.
- Add CSRF protection for non-API forms (NextAuth mitigates many flows).

Testing strategy (applies to a monolith layout)
- Unit test models and services (Vitest/Jest)
- Integration tests for route handlers (supertest or Playwright against preview deploy)
- E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) covering the critical flows (login, create product, move stock, PO receive)
- Worker tests: test queue operations locally with Redis and a sandbox DB.

Operational runbook snippets
- How to re-run failed stock movement job (have a job retry UI).
- How to rebuild search index.
- How to restore DB from backup into sandbox.

Checklist: what to implement first (practical order)
1. Provision infra for dev: MongoDB Atlas dev cluster, Redis dev instance, local docker-compose for Mongo+Redis.
2. Scaffolding: Next.js app with TypeScript, tailwind, eslint, basic layout + Storybook.
3. Auth: NextAuth + Mongo adapter; user + company onboarding flow.
4. Prisma or Mongoose models + migrations/seed scripts (seed sample products/warehouses).
5. Product CRUD + inventory snapshot server pages (server components).
6. Stock movement route + transaction logic + audit logging.
7. Simple worker + queue and one queued job (e.g., email alert on low stock).
8. Add Sentry, logging, and basic metrics.
9. Add AI integration endpoints as queued jobs, not synchronous.
10. E2E tests for core flows.

Decision helper (quick)
- If you want the fastest route to an MVP and you expect to evolve: use monolithic Next.js + Mongoose + Atlas + Redis + BullMQ.
- If you already know you’ll require independent scaling or multiple teams: implement a separate Node.js backend (NestJS recommended) and treat Next.js as only frontend.

Final concrete next steps I can do for you now
- If you want a hands-on scaffold: I can generate a starter scaffold for this repo (Next.js app, tsconfig, tailwind, Mongoose models for Product/Inventory, example route handlers, auth wiring with NextAuth, worker skeleton using BullMQ). Say “scaffold” and I will generate the files.
- Or I can generate the complete API contract (OpenAPI) for the endpoints listed above so frontend and backend agree on types.
- Or I can produce a full detailed DB schema & ER/collection diagrams for MongoDB and a migration/seed script.

Which of those do you want me to do next? If you’re undecided, say “Recommend scaffold for monolith” and I’ll generate the starter files (with Mongoose models, example routes, and worker skeleton).
